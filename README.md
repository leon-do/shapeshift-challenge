# shapeshift-challenge

`$ node server.js`

Joe wants to send <20 bitcoin> to each of his three kids none of which have a bitcoin wallet. They have each requested that he send them coin in their favorite currencies: 
Ethereum, Litecoin, and DASH. 

Joe wants to get the best rates possible when he converts the coins to give his children. Write a web app that will find out what the best exchanges would be for each of these trades. The app should talk to two exchange (some suggestions: BTC-E, Poloniex, Bittrex) api's to get real data. 

The results should display what the exchange rate is at all the exchanges for each of the 3 trades Joe want do and highlight which is the best rate at each.

Other considerations:
For backend or full stack dev applicants:
    Please complete the challenge using Nodejs.  
    Can simply print out results in console log.

Extra points for: 
- using ES6/ES7 
- tracking results over time
- integrating data from more exchanges
- display how much more Joe will get when he makes each trade at exchange A vs exchange B
- make results accessible via an api
- display results in web page
